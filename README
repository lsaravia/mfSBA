Multifractal estimation using a standard box-counting algorithm

Software used to determine multifractal spectra: Generalized dimensions Dq and spectrum 
of singularities f(alfa), the software was used in the paper:

ï»¿Saravia LA, et al. 2012. Multifractal growth in periphyton communities. Oikos 0, 0.

mfSBA estimate both spectra and outputs data to evaluate the fits

mfSBArnz estimate the Dq spectrun and randomize the original image N times to 
calculate a confidence interval to test the hipothesis that the original distribution
was random. 

The programs accept as input tiff, rst (idrisi raster files) and sed files. 

p1-1-05-05.sed is an example of a multifractal generated by a multiplicative process with
parameters p1=1 p2=1 p3=0.5 p4=0.5 this is explained in:

Martinez, V J, et al. 1990 Clustering paradigms and multifractal measures. 
Astrophysical Journal 357: 50-61.

q21.sed is a file with q values used to estimat spectra.
