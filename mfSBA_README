Multifractal spectra estimation using the canonical method [1]

Usage:

mfSBA inputFile qFile minBox maxBox numBoxSizes option

inputFile: this file can have only two formats 1) one layer tiff 2) sed file format.
Sed File is a format I invented to use with my stochastic cellular automata models to
represent a square grid of values. 
it has a header of two lines, the first line describes the dimensions X Y of the data
the second line describes the type of data, for this program the type must be BI, that
means the grid can have real numbers with double precision. See the example files.

qFile: is a sed file with the q to calculate the multifractal spectra

minBox,maxBox,numBoxSizes: Minimun box size, maximun box size and number of sizes of boxes.
The program uses boxsize in powers of two, maxBoxSize can't be greater than the half of the image.
numBoxSize: if is less than the number of powers of 2 that number will be used, so put a 
bigger number 

option N: Not normalize measure
       S: Normalize measure -> SUM all the pixels and divide each pixel by that value
       D: Add 1 and normalize -> Add 1 to all the image then normalize
       A: Normalize measure and save
